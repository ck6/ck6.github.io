    <h2>A Note from Our Team</h2>
    <p>We’re a small startup excited about building fun Telegram mini games—especially ones featuring adorable Chonks! We made this treasure hunt with lots of love (and some real BTC, TON, and USDT). We genuinely hope you enjoy playing, invite your friends, and potentially find life-changing rewards. Everything you uncover is real, and we’ll be thrilled if it brightens your day.</p>

  <h2>FAQ</h2>

  <!-- FAQ items -->
  <div>
    <div class="faq-question">1. Are these rewards real? Can I withdraw them?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      Yes! The tokens you collect (BTC, USDT, TON) are genuine and accumulate in your account. You can see your balances in the <strong>Wallet</strong> tab. Withdrawals happen weekly, provided you meet the minimum balance of $20.
    </div>

    <div class="faq-question">2. How do I reveal tiles?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      You need cookies (or other sweets) to reveal each tile. Tap a hex tile, and if you have at least one cookie in your inventory, that tile will flip to show any reward hidden beneath.
    </div>

    <div class="faq-question">3. I ran out of cookies. What should I do?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      If you don’t have any cookies, a popup will appear directing you to the <strong>Store</strong> tab. Head there to buy more cookies (or candy, or bombs) so you can keep unveiling tiles.
    </div>

    <div class="faq-question">4. How do I earn more cookies or unlock bigger items?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      Go to the <strong>Store</strong> tab to purchase various items using Telegram’s built-in payment system. Some items require you to invite friends first—check your <strong>Bonuses</strong> tab to see how many invites you need to unlock them.
    </div>

    <div class="faq-question">5. How do I invite friends?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      In the <strong>Bonuses</strong> tab, there’s an <strong>Invite</strong> button and a <strong>Copy Link</strong> button. Share your personal link with friends on Telegram or anywhere else. Each new friend you invite helps you unlock additional items (and sometimes free cookies!).
    </div>

    <div class="faq-question">6. Why connect a TON wallet?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      Connecting your TON wallet allows you to withdraw TON directly to your personal address. If you’d like to receive TON rewards off-platform, simply press the <strong>Connect</strong> button under the <strong>Wallet</strong> tab and follow the prompts.
    </div>

    <div class="faq-question">7. What is the “Chonk” and how does feeding work?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      The Chonk is our friendly mascot. Each time you uncover rewards, you “feed” the Chonk. As you feed it more, you level up and increase your overall bonus on winnings. Check the <strong>Bonuses</strong> tab or the feeding progress bar to see your current level and bonus.
    </div>

    <div class="faq-question">8. Can I select a specific cluster?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      Yes! In the <strong>Treasure</strong> tab (the main field), tap <strong>Select Cluster</strong> at the bottom and enter a cluster number. Clusters range from <em>1 to 3,333,334</em>. You can also load a random one anytime by tapping <strong>Random Cluster</strong>.
    </div>

    <div class="faq-question">9. Where can I get more help or support?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      If you have any questions or run into any issues, tap the <strong>Support</strong> link in the <strong>Wallet</strong> tab or message 
      <a href="https://t.me/luckychonksupport" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@luckychonksupport</a> on Telegram.
